 A collection of examples scripts of fuctionality and workflows used by myself.

 --------
 geodesic_example: Example of geodesic interpolator implemented in CARMM, adapted for ASE to use FixAtom constraints and periodic boundary conditionbs. Examples include: 1) complex ring closing Diels-Alder reaction and, 2) the formation of DME on a zeolitic framework with constraints and PBCs.
